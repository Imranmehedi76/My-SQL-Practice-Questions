# My-SQL-Practice-Questions

Lately, I've been working on some SQL challenges to sharpen my data analysis and database management skills.

These queries cover everything from filtering employee records to ranking customers and analyzing sales trends.

🔍 Some key challenges I worked on:

> Extracting employee and sales data using joins & filters.

> Segmenting customers based on their country with a CASE statement.

> Identifying top-selling products and tracking order frequency.

> Creating optimized database tables with primary/foreign key constraints.

> Developing stored procedures & triggers to automate data handling.
